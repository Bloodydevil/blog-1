teaser: How a GitHub streak (can) improve software
---

I have lately been setting myself a challenge, I want to keep up my pace of
developing software by keeping my GitHub streak alive. Before I start to talk
about experiences I have encountered so far I want to make clear I don't do
this to create a GitHub CV or anything there are enough discussions about this
on hacker news, reddit, ecetera.
